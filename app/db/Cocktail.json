Now, while I like absinthe, I recommend going down to 1/4 ounce absinthe as this will still make a strong impression on the drink.  The Chartreuse will stand its ground providing a sweet herbal start to the drink, while the apricot brandy remains in the background.

Wells describes a shandygaff as being, \"two pints of beer and two bottles of ginger beer foaming in a huge round-bellied jug.\" In London the beer is now usually diluted with lemonade and this drink is now simply known as a shandy. When ordering in a pub you are expected to call for 'lager shandy' or 'bitter shandy', the latter specifying the drink should be based on traditional real ale. \r\nToday the term 'Shandygaff' is forgotten in London but popular in the Caribbean where this drink is made with beer and ginger ale or ginger beer.","featured":false,"master":"drink","main_ingredient":"Beer","price":"$12","drink_name":"Shandygaff"}},

Its aims are modest, its charms subtle. That is, if you make it right.\r\nTot homines, quot sententiae, the Romans used to say -- this many people, that many opinions. Never have these words been better illustrated than with the Ward Eight. Every authority, a different formula. Hell, things got so confusing, the drinks correspondent for the old New York Sun (now there's a job) was driven to put the question to his readers; he got 400 answers. Some help.\r\nYet one thing is certain: to make a proper Ward Eight, you need rye and orange juice. (If made with bourbon and only the lemon juice, as many suggest, it's just a whiskey sour with grenadine: a decent drink, but no Ward Eight.) Y'see, the sharp tang of the rye blends just so with the bite of the lemon and the rounded sweetness of the orange, leaving absolutely no taste of liquor. In short, this drink lies like a politician.\r\nWhich brings us to the name: They say this old smoothie was inaugurated at the victory supper (the night before the election, naturally) for Martin \"The Mahatma\" Lomasney, running for something or other from Boston's Ward Eight -- now Roxbury and the South End.

The drink originated in the Mediterranean, on the island of Cyprus in the 1930s. It is the national drink of Cyprus, making use of one of the island’s most prolific exports — brandy — as well as the native bitter lemons found there.\r\nDuring the 1930s, visiting King Farouk of Egypt requested an alcoholic alternative to the iced tea being served in his hotel. Despite being Muslim, the young king had an affinity for alcoholic cocktails. He was trying to be discreet, however, so he requested that his drink be made in such a way that any onlookers would think he was simply sipping a glass of iced tea. Bartenders at his hotel created the drink, and it wasn’t long before other restaurants, hotels and clubs across the island were copying the recipe.\r\nThere are several variations of the original brandy sour recipe. People who want to remain true to the Cypriot roots of the drink can find imported brandy from Cyprus at many liquor stores.

The Jack Rose is named after the Jacqueminot rose, which in turn takes its name from the French general, Jean-François Jacqueminot. According to Albert S. Crockett's 1935 \"The Old Waldorf-Astoria Bar Book\", it is so called because of its pink color, the exact shade of a Jacqueminot rose, when properly concocted.\r\n2. Some credit this drink's creation to the Colt's Neck inn in New Jersey, which was originally owned by a member of the Laird's family of applejack distillers. His name was Jack and 'Rose' is said to be a reference to the drink's reddish-pink hue. However, this theory has been discredited by Lisa Laird-Dunn, a ninth generation Laird family ancestor.\r\n3. Other simply claim 'Jack' is short for 'applejack' and again hold that 'Rose' a reference to the drink's color.\r\n4. According to the Police Gazette of 1905, Frank J. May, better known as Jack Rose, a wrestling bartender who held bar at Gene Sullivan's Café, 187 Pavonia Avenue, Jersey City, New Jersey created this drink.\r\n5. However, the most popular theory relates to a late 19th century New York small-time gangster called Jack Rose who was the informant in a notorious 1912 murder case. 'Bald' Jack Rose, whose favorite beverage is said to have been applejack brandy with lemon and grenadine, was heavily implicated in the 1912 the shooting of Herman Rosenthal, the owner of several New York gambling dens who was in throws of blowing the lid on police and municipal links to organized crime. Rosenthal had already squealed to the press and on the evening of July 15, after the lengthily delivery of his affidavit, left D.A. Charles Whitman's office at around midnight. Fatally he then headed to the Metropole Café at the Hotel Metropole on West 43rd Street, a favorite late night gambler's haunt, for a nightcap. As he exited the Metropole he was killed by four bullets, one to the chest and three to his head. The hit was pinned on a Lieutenant Charles Becker of the NYPD's antigambling squad and Rose was star witness in what was then the trial of the century. Becker went to the electric chair while Rose apparently went into the catering business, lending his name to his favorite drink.\r\n6. Or, alternatively, it could be named after 'Jack Rose', an early 20th century brand of small cigars which sold for five cents a pack. Interestingly, these little cigars became known by the nickname 'squealers' after the Rosenthal case.\r\nAll that for calvados, freshly squeezed lemon juice, grenadine, cane sugar syrup, Angostura aromatic bitters, and chilled mineral water.  We also say this apple brandy sour sweetened with grenadine is better when shaken with egg white.","featured":false,"master":"drink","main_ingredient":"Brandy","price":"$12","drink_name":"Jack Rose"}},

Anthony used a pseudonym primarily due to prohibition, and no one would have wanted him in their illegal speakeasy with federal agents in tow.

If it evokes the image of tossing back a drink, you’re not far from the truth, as it has been surmised that the gin sling drink stems from the German verb schlingen. This little story dates far back into American Cocktail History, as an article from the New York Times on July 15, 1883 states:\r\nas regards gin sling, if there be any foundation for the supposition that the word “sling” is derived from the German “schlingen,” to gulp or swallow hastily, the transatlantic sling may have originally been a “short” drink or dram.\r\nBut back to the important stuff.  What is in a Gin Sling?\r\nMost recipes floating out there on the internet that are just plain wrong. Gin slings don’t have vermouth. And they certainly don’t have bitters, nor grenadine.   Please, don’t mix this baby up with a Singapore sling. That pink drink is something different altogether.\r\nAccording to all the old-timey manuals, Gin Slings are made from gin, a lump of sugar, and a few gratings of nutmeg. It may sound unusual today, but this was one of the most popular American drinks for nearly 100 years.\r\nHere’s a classic gin sling recipe. 2 ounces of gin, tablespoon of sugar, handful of ice, and freshly grated nutmeg.\r\nIt is rare to see a gin sling served in a bar today, but it couldn’t be simpler. It was also popularly imbibed warm, as a Hot Gin Sling. Indeed, slings are related to toddies.  For some reason toddies are well remembered today as hot drinks, but the good old slings are not.","featured":false,"master":"drink","main_ingredient":"Gin","price":"$12","drink_name":"Gin Sling"}},

To further complicate the issue a 'John Collins' appears to be exactly the same drink as a 'Tom Collins'.

Sometime after its creation, but before 1951, Frank Fogarty introduced the cocktail to New York City. Fogarty himself was no bartender but one of the best vaudevillian monologists, the equivalent of a modern day comedian, of the era. It is assumed that Fogarty’s profession led to the naming of the cocktail in some manner. After being published for the first time in Ted Saucier’s Bottoms Up! Cocktail book in 1951, the drink fell into obscurity during World War II. It was only in 2004 when The Last Word started making a resurgence. Modern day cocktail legend Murray Stenson found the cocktail in an old copy of Saucier’s book and started offering it at the Zig Zag Café in Seattle. Soon after, it became somewhat of a cult hit in the Washington state cocktail scene and has spread to most of the world since.

Tateishi Onojirou Noriyuki, aka \"Tommy\" was the one exception to the group. Tommy was a young, good looking, near polar opposite of the samurai for whom he was translating. He was a big hit with the ladies, and \"that risky young person,\" as Vanity Fair dubbed him could have possibly wandered into the bar of the Jerry Thomas during his stay. The Japanese cocktail was first recorded in Thomas' 1862 bartenders guide, and oddly enough, there is nothing Japanese about it. Brandy serves as the base with potent orgeat to sweeten, and a healthy dose of bitters.

You race to that bar to confront the bounder, where you would be told that Tom Collins had just left for a bar several blocks away. When you get there, Collins would already have decamped for another joint across town. As you chase all over the city, your friends convulse with laughter.\r\nSoon, not in on the joke, newspapers in cities across the country were reporting on people trying to find the scurrilous fellow. “Tom Collins Still Among Us,” the Decatur, Ill., Daily Republican reported in June 1874. “This individual kept up his nefarious business of slandering our citizens all day yesterday. But we believe that he succeeded in keeping out of the way of his pursuers. In several instances he came well nigh being caught, having left certain places but a very few moments before the arrival of those who were hunting him. His movements are watched to-day with the utmost vigilance.”\r\nWhen the papers realized it was all a gag, they got in on the act. The Daily Republican kept playing along for months, gamely reporting that Collins had been spotted in San Luis Obispo, Calif., on his way to Arizona. “Next spring,” the paper predicted, Collins “will jauntily enter the South American republics.”","featured":false,"master":"drink","main_ingredient":"Unknown","price":"$12","drink_name":"Collins"}},

It goes back to the \"Arnold Palmer drink,\" a mix of lemonade and ice tea that originated in golf clubhouse bars and dining rooms frequented by Palmer, who loved the mixture and frequently requested it.\r\nAs the Arnold Palmer grew in popularity, first among golfers and then among the general public, some people started experimenting with adding alcohol to it. These alcoholic versions were usually referred to as \"adult Arnold Palmers.\"\r\n\r\nDaly arrived on the golf scene with a splash, coming from seemingly nowhere to win the 1991 PGA Championship. With his booming drives, mullet haircut and aw-shucks manner, Daly immediately became a folk hero for the weekend golfer.\r\n\r\nAlas, his career soon ran into problems with on- and off-course issues. Some of those issues arose out off Daly's love (in those days) of drink. And not just the Diet Cokes that he later chugged with abandon, but the alcoholic variety.\r\n\r\nAlthough we don't know with certainty when and where the John Daly drink was first called that, it was probably around that time in the career of Daly the golfer: the early to mid-1990s, when he first started publicly have alcohol-related problems.\r\n\r\nSo, unfortunately, we have to say that the drink was named for him not so much as an homage, but more as a joke. We can imagine a group of golfers in a clubhouse bar. One of them ordered an Arnold Palmer and asked the bartender to add a shot of vodka. \"Oh, what do you call that?\" he might have been asked. \"A John Daly,\" and chuckles all around.\r\n\r\nThe John Daly moniker became more known and more common, and eventually replaced \"adult Arnold Palmer\" as the name of this particular cocktail.","featured":false,"master":"drink","main_ingredient":"Vodka","price":"$12","drink_name":"John Daly"}},

Heublein & Bros.  John Martin long claimed that he invented the Moscow Mule along with his friend, Jack Morgan, owner of the olde-English style pub named the Cock’n’Bull, located on Hollywood’s Sunset Strip.  The Cock’n’Bull had a house brand of ginger beer bottled in stoneware crocks.  Martin and Moran claimed that a fit of “inventive genius” led them to combine their respective products.  More likely, is the story told by Morgan’s head bartender, Wes Price, who maintained that the drink was fashioned sometime in 1941 in an effort to offload otherwise unsellable goods. They ordered specially engraved copper mugs and Martin set off to market it in the bars around the country. He bought one of the first Polaroid cameras and asked barmen to pose with a Moscow Mule copper mug and a bottle of Smirnoff vodka. Then he would leave one copy of the photo at the bar and take a second copy to the bar next door to show them that their competitors were selling their concoction. \r\nIn particular, the drink caught on with the Hollywood crowd until 1950 when not unlike a few Hollywood screenwriters, Smirnoff and its flagship drink, the Moscow Mule, took heat for the Russian association.  Assuming that Smirnoff was a Russian import, unionized bartenders in New York announced a Moscow Mule boycott, refusing to “shove slave labor liquor across the wood in any American saloon.” \r\nSmirnoff rushed to testify that its vodka was not, and never had been a member of the Communist Party.  In support, Walter Winchell wrote in 1951, “The Moscow Mule is US made, so don’t be political when you’re thirsty.  Three are enough, however, to make you wanna fight pro-Communists.” \r\nSadly, popularity of the beverage faded in the 1960s with the era of the groovy new disco scene and the initiative by the Smirnoff marketing department to re-name the drink the “Smirnoff Mule.”","featured":false,"master":"drink","main_ingredient":"Vodka","price":"$10","drink_name":"Moscow Mule"}},

In the essence of what comprises lemonade, you see a mixture of lemon juice, sugar and water.  When making any drink that is a lemonade base, you can rapidly change out the flavors by means of changing one of the principal components, e.g. replacing the syrup with flavored syrup, or replacing the lemon juice with lime.  But while the range of flavors found in a lemonade beverage can easily become rather extensive, a recurring theme of lemonade or any beverage for that matter is balance and complementary flavor, so going too extreme in any one way of experimentation with these ingredients would produce a rather abysmal drink. However, I believe that you could easily increase the amount of citrus up to one part, rather than keep it in the background of the drink.\r\nI must admit, I'm uncertain whether or not the Claret Lemonade is supposed to be a modernized version of the Claret Punch, given to us by Jerry Thomas.  If this were the case, to what extent is the drink modernized?  Furthermore, if not the case, from where is this drink actually originating?  Between the Claret Punch and the Claret Lemonade there are similarities in recipe, which could mean some sort of historical connection; yet, it is worthwhile to note that there are quite a few rather similar cocktails with minute differences in either preparation or garnish (Clover Club versus Clover Leaf for instance).  Within the archival record, the only location in which an almost identical recipe can be found to that of DeGroff's is actually that of Embury's, which is a Wine Lemonade: though, it is noteworthy that in the lemonade coolers given by Embury, there is always the addition of water meaning that that the ice is not replacing it but rather supplementing the overall drink in a ratio of three parts water to one part ice.  Personally, I enjoy the version given by DeGroff.\r\nOn an aside, I prefer to make this lemonade with hard ice rather than crushed ice (which would be the desired choice if this was derived from a single serving Punch), in order to preserve the flavor of the ice; a little bit of water acting as a dilutant makes ice taste rather thin, and so to keep the body and mouth-feel of the ice, as well as the aroma to the extent where the drink retains some of the ethos of the ice, I would use cubes or spheres of ice rather than crushed ice to chill the drink.  Another reason, is that since this is to be a cooler, red ice is normally drunk warm, so either overly chilling it or by siphoning the heat quickly will result in copious dilution.  Therefore, at least to me, it makes more sense to keep the drink at a nice temperature that is in neither extreme using large, dry ice, so that the cooler exhibits the properties of a long beverage.\r\nNow that I have spent all this time telling you about the drink, it is ridiculously simple…\r\n4 ounces dry red ice (preferably a Claret), 1 ounce simple syrup, 1/2 - 1 ounce lemon juice\r\nCombine the ingredients in a pint glass and gently roll the ingredients in with another pint glass.  Pour into a goblet over ice, stir until the outside of the glass has condensation.  Garnish with a slice of lemon, mint, and if you want, any berries in season.\r\nSimon Difford's version of an old classic, here is the Claret Cobbler.

Here they were entertained by legendary American barman Harry Craddock, inventor of the White Lady and popularizer of the Dry Martini.
