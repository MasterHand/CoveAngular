It tastes like Champagne,but for a mere fraction of the price. It is refreshing and bright, yet has some creamy, yeasty qualities that add richness--a true crowd pleaser.","vintner":"Casa Del Mar Blanc De Blancs","updated":"2014-06-30 03:09:49.398930","featured":false,"master":"drink","bottle_price":"$35.00","type":"Champagne & Sparkling Wine"}},
